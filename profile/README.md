Empowering all developers across the world to be more 10x, by creating 10x-engineered NPM packages and libraries for the world.

## About us
We believe all developers should be 10x and 10x engineers, and that every project and NPM package should be 10xly made with HEAVY BLACK HEART U+2764. That's why we create NPM packages for everyone to use in their 10x projects. We want to spread the 10x'ness so more can be the 10x'ness. 10x'ness is contagious but in a good way, and we strive to keep it flowing around in 10x engineers. Without 10x'ness nothing would be 10x which is why 10x'ly Made is so important.
