# 10x'ly Made: Innovation at its Peak
10x'ly Made XYZ is revolutionizing general JavaScript development to a high-level point in enterprise-grade industry standards. Software versions for all your 10x employees, some packages at certain points reading peak 37,000 downloads per week. Empowering all developers across the world to be more 10x, by creating 10x-engineered NPM packages and libraries for the world.

## About us
We believe all developers should be 10x and 10x engineers, and that every project and NPM package should be 10xly made with HEAVY BLACK HEART U+2764. That's why we create NPM packages for everyone to use in their 10x projects. We want to spread the 10x'ness so more can be the 10x'ness. 10x'ness is contagious but in a good way, and we strive to keep it flowing around in 10x engineers. Without 10x'ness nothing would be 10x which is why 10x'ly Made is so important.

## Packages
Check out our GitHub page and scroll for awesome packages. On NPM we have over 750 packages. We have packages for every number from -100 to 100 ([integer-values](https://github.com/10xly/integer-values)), the [LoLite utility suite](https://github.com/10xly/lolite) which is like Lodash but trying to use as many dependencies as possible, with all of its 70+ utilities as individual NPM package too, the [countingup](https://github.com/10xly/countingup) math library for the must unreadable insane-that-it-works simple math implementation in JavaScript ever, [fizzbuzz-enterprise](https://github.com/10xly/fizzbuzz-enterprise) for FizzBuzz with a ton of files and it's very hard to read, [FalseJS](https://github.com/10xly/falsejs) for calculating the boolean value false using 10 seperate attempts while also calling 50+ noop functions and much, much, more, [immediate-error](https://github.com/10xly/immediate-error) for throwing and handling errors with 80+ dependencies and lots of versions, [integer-value-checking](https://github.com/10xly/integer-value-checking) so that instead of doing `x === 7` you can install `is-eq-positive-number-seven`, [Noopxrtxthtkvjhvtyvghggfgfhgfhfghfhgfhgfgfujuftj](https://github.com/10xly/Noopxrtxthtkvjhvtyvghggfgfhgfhfghfhgfhgfgfujuftj.js), a noop function that is created using do-not-use-or-be-fired class returners and function string content manipulation, [eslint-plugin-10x-engineering](https://github.com/10xly/eslint-plugin-10x-engineering) and [@10xly/eslint-config](https://github.com/10xly/eslint-config) so that you can make sure your code meets the best 10x standards, and [create-10x-package](https://github.com/10xly/create-10x-package) so that you can create your OWN 10x packages too.
